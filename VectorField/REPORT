This implementation has absolutely no problems... It is 100% perfect. Guaranteed or your money back!

Oh no, you didn't pay for this code?

You mean to tell me that I paid out-of-state tuition to write this code?

Problem 1)
Floating point precision isn't standardized on older GPU's. New one's even support double  precision, but like everything else with graphics cards it's a crap-shoot.

Problem 2)
We have no control over what features the user's GPU supports. We would need to write code for each version of OpenGL in order to support a large number of cards.

Problem 3)
Euler's method kinda sucks. There are more accurate methods of estimating functions.
